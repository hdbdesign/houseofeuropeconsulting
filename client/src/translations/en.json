During the mentoring, I took personality tests, we talked about what I like to do, what I'm good at... and everything started to make more sense. It was a relief to realize that I can choose subjects that fit me and my future. Now I feel much calmer and excited because I know I'm choosing a path that suits me. Honestly, it was an experience that helped me a lot! If you're also confused or don't know where to start, I highly recommend this mentoring. It made the difference for me.Â«",
