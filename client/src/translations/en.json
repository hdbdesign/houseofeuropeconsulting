I am in constant contact with mentors and in atmospheres that lead me to growth, but the Metanoia Mentoring led me to see in myself points that I would never have expected and that redirected my entire personal and professional focus. Transformative and timely encounter. I can only thank and recommend. Amazing!!«",

You transformed a complex process into something light and possible. Besides providing impeccable service, you transmit security and confidence, which makes all the difference. Immense gratitude!

During the mentoring, I took personality tests, we talked about what I like to do, what I'm good at... and everything started to make more sense. It was a relief to realize that I can choose subjects that fit me and my future. Now I feel much calmer and excited because I know I'm choosing a path that suits me. Honestly, it was an experience that helped me a lot! If you're also confused or don't know where to start, I highly recommend this mentoring. It made the difference for me.«",
