I am in constant contact with mentors and in atmospheres that lead me to growth, but the Metanoia Mentoring led me to see in myself points that I would never have expected and that redirected my entire personal and professional focus. Transformative and timely encounter. I can only thank and recommend. Amazing!!Â«",

You were with me in every detail, from preparing the Business Plan in German, through opening the company, to the visa process for my entire family. You transformed a complex process into something light and possible. Besides providing impeccable service, you transmit security and confidence, which makes all the difference. Immense gratitude! May more people be able to count on your talent!Â«",

During the mentoring, I took personality tests, we talked about what I like to do, what I'm good at... and everything started to make more sense. It was a relief to realize that I can choose subjects that fit me and my future. Now I feel much calmer and excited because I know I'm choosing a path that suits me. Honestly, it was an experience that helped me a lot! If you're also confused or don't know where to start, I highly recommend this mentoring. It made the difference for me.Â«",
